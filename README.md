# isort-vim-2

Yet another vim isort plugin

## Why?

I couldn't get either of the other two i found (`fisadev/vim-isort` or `stsewd/isort.nvim`) to play nicely with `BufWritePre`

Pretty much completely copied from [`psf/black`](https://github.com/psf/black), with minor tweaks to plug in isort instead
